# Python term 1 week 6 saturday class

## Building a calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user. 
2 inputs as numbers (floats) for operation. Third input is which operation to perform. 

## Lists
Composiste data type. Single variable able to store multiple values (even values of different data types!).
Each piece is called an element. 'First' element is really the zeroth element. 

## Loops
Like Post Malone: running in circles.
Used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met (or you some other method breaks the loop).

## DRY coding principles
Don't
Repeat
Yourself

## Range
A pre-defined function that generates a sequences of numbers.

Useful for loops iterating over a specific number of times. 

Syntax: range(start, stop, step)
Examples:
range(1, 10, 2) starts counting at 1, going up by 2 each time and ending at 10. 
range(5) starts counting at 1 ending at 5, going up by 1 each time. 

## For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended statements. 
for var in sequence:
    code to be executed

## Practice Example 1
Finding the sum of 1 - 10.

## Practice Example 2
Find largest number in a list.
list = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]
